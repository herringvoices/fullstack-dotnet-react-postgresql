Below is an example **README** that describes **your Bash script itself** (rather than the project it generates). This is the “meta” readme that explains what the script does, how to run it, and what prerequisites folks need in order to use it successfully.

## Overview

This repository contains a single **Bash script** (`apitemplate.sh`, for example) that automates the creation of a **full-stack** web application using:

- **.NET 8 WebAPI** (with ASP.NET Identity for authentication)  
- **PostgreSQL** (via Entity Framework Core)  
- **React** (created with Vite, plus React-Bootstrap, React Router, and FontAwesome)

Instead of manually scaffolding all these components, you can run **one** script to generate an end-to-end, ready-to-run project.

---

## What the Script Does

When you run this script, it will:

1. **Ask** you for a .NET project name (this becomes the folder name and namespace).  
2. **Create** a .NET 8 WebAPI project with Identity and EF Core set up for PostgreSQL.  
3. **Initialize** user-secrets to securely store your PostgreSQL connection string and admin password.  
4. **Generate** some boilerplate code:
   - `DbContext` with migrations  
   - `AuthController` for login/logout/register  
   - Basic models/DTOs  
5. **Create** a React frontend (with Vite) in a `client` directory, installing:
   - `react-bootstrap`, `react-router-dom`, `FontAwesome`, etc.  
6. **Set up** an EF Core migration and run `dotnet ef database update` to create/update the DB.  
7. **Run `npm install`** automatically in the `client` directory so you don’t have to.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Bash**: You’ll need a Unix-like shell. (If you’re on Windows, consider using WSL or Git Bash.)
2. **.NET 8 SDK**: Install from [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
3. **Node.js**: Needed for the React portion. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
4. **PostgreSQL**: Locally or via Docker. The script defaults to `Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=postgres`.

> **Important**: The script will ask for your PostgreSQL password and store it in **user-secrets** (not in source control). Make sure you actually have a `postgres` user with that password.

---

## How to Use

You have two main options:

### Option 1: Run from GitHub Directly

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/apitemplate.sh)
```

1. **Enter** a project name when prompted (e.g. `MyCoolProject`).  
2. **Enter** your PostgreSQL password.  
3. **Enter** an admin password for the seeded admin user in Identity.  
4. Watch as the script scaffolds everything!

When it’s done, you’ll have a new folder named after your project. Inside, you’ll see the .NET backend, the `client` React app, and all your connections set up.

### Option 2: Clone This Repo and Run Locally

1. **Clone** or **download** this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   ```
2. **Make the script executable** (just in case):
   ```bash
   chmod +x apitemplate.sh
   ```
3. **Run it**:
   ```bash
   ./apitemplate.sh
   ```
4. Follow the same prompts as above (project name, DB password, admin password).

## PostgreSQL: Local vs Docker

### Local Postgres

If you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine:
- Ensure it’s **running** on port `5432`.  
- The default superuser is `postgres` (with whatever password you set during install).

When the script asks for a DB password, use the same one you have in PostgreSQL.

### Docker Postgres

If you don’t want to install PostgreSQL locally, you can run it in Docker:

```bash
docker run --name postgresql \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres
```

- Replace `mysecretpassword` with your actual password.
- The script will connect via `localhost:5432` as `postgres` using that password.  
- Make sure `-p 5432:5432` is present so your host machine’s `localhost` sees Postgres at `5432`.

> If you prefer a container name other than `postgresql`, that’s fine—just keep `-p 5432:5432` so you can still access it as `localhost:5432`.

## Resulting Project Structure

Once the script finishes, you’ll have a structure similar to:

```
MyCoolProject/
├─ Controllers/
│  └─ AuthController.cs
├─ Data/
│  └─ MyCoolProjectDbContext.cs
├─ DTOs/
│  ├─ RegistrationDTO.cs
│  └─ UserProfileDTO.cs
├─ Models/
│  └─ UserProfile.cs
├─ client/
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ package.json
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ managers/
│  │  └─ App.jsx
│  └─ vite.config.js
├─ Program.cs
├─ initialsetup.sh
└─ ...
```

**Key points**:
- **`initialsetup.sh`** is an extra script that helps restore, set user secrets, run migrations again, etc.  
- The `.NET` WebAPI references user-secrets for the Postgres connection string and admin password.  
- The React app has routes for login, register, and includes React-Bootstrap-based UI.

When you’re ready:
- **Back-end**: `dotnet run` from the `MyCoolProject` root.  
- **Front-end**: `cd client && npm run dev`.

That’s it—you have a fully functional full-stack app with authentication, migrations, and a clean architecture, all set up by **one** script.

## Questions & Troubleshooting

- **DB Connection Fails**: Make sure Postgres is running on the correct port and the username/password match the one you entered.
- **SSL Errors** (on Windows) sometimes happen with `npm create vite@latest`. Ensure your Node version is up to date.
- Feel free to open issues or PRs if you find bugs or want new features.

Enjoy your new **.NET + React + PostgreSQL** project! And remember: fewer hours spent on boilerplate = more hours spent building cool features. Good luck and happy coding!
